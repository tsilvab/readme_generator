## Description

AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

A command-line application that accepts user input. A high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests and Questions

## Table of Contents

- Installation
- Usage
- License

## Installation

Repository includes a package.json with required dependencies. I created one in visual studio code through the intergrated terminal

node.js/
dependencies: inquirer, axios

## Usage

Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded.

## License

MIT LICENSE
